# Unified system of donations
#### P.S. This is my first attempt at implementing a microservice architecture, so some decisions may be wrong. ðŸ«¶
## Introduction

Problems of the chosen subject area:
- Fragmentation of information.
- Lack of centralization.
- Lack of transparency.

- The architectural pattern of the entire system is **Microservice Architecture**.
- The only access point is the **Ocelot** gateway.
- **JWT** token is used for authorization and authentication.
- Each microservice is implemented as a **RestFull API** and deployed in **docker** containers.
- Each microservice has its own database, which interacts with the **Entity Framework** and is implemented using the **repository pattern**.
- Each microservice sends its logs to **Seq** using **RabbitMq**
- RealTime microservice uses **SignalR** to send notifications and comments in real time.
- **Postman** was used for convenient storage and calling the api
## Functions
The system is divided into three roles (sponsor, fund owner, administrator).

### Sponsor:
- Registration and authorization
- View Funds
- View projects and goals
- Subscribe to a fund to receive notifications (if authorized)
- Commenting on projects (if authorized)

### Fund Owner:
- Includes sponsor features
- Editing a fund (about the fund, media, members)
- Create/edit/delete projects
- Create/edit/delete collection targets
- Edit report (if fundraising is over)

### Admin:
- Includes sponsor and fund owner functions, but has access to all funds
- Creating/deleting a fund and assigning an owner
- Has access to api which includes all functions from the web version + ability to create/edit/delete data from auxiliary database tables (payment type, media type, etc)
